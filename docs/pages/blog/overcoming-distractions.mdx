# Overcoming Distractions: Staying Focused in Your Learning Journey

::authors

Have you ever thought that you are not enough to keep moving forward, and you need to learn more? Probably, many of us thought it at some point. The best way to eliminate these thoughts is to learn more, right? This may be the answer, and if you make this answer your motto, you'll probably realize learning never ends. This is also right.

I would like you to recommend how to bend this loop and make it work according to your intentions. From my point of view, the most important is to draw your limitations until the next step which means that you have to start from tiny pieces before the big picture. Therefore, you can focus on fundamentals by ignoring the concept. In short, you need a solid foundation to build anything substantial.

Another crucial point is to ignore the hype around you, whether it comes from social media, friends, or other sources. For instance, if you're in the middle of learning Python, and suddenly everyone on Twitter is talking about Go, it can be tempting to follow them. The noise can be overwhelming and create a false thought to learn everything at once. Instead, stay focused on what you've already started. Remember, trends come and go, and it's impossible to keep up with them all. Stick to your plan, and enjoy missing out.

Also, I want to talk about trying to compete with people you know. This one can be irritating and put you behind. I mean, you are on your own in your world and reality. Competing with someone you know does not make you the best of yourself. Finding ways how can we help each other and be beneficial to each other is much more meaningful. As a primate, we are strong together in the end.

Finally, while itâ€™s natural to have role models, be cautious of overly admiring and mimicking someone else. I want to indicate that It looks fine at first glance. This can lead to losing your individuality and becoming a copy of them. I can say that it is good to become yourself and not pretend like others.

Consequently, you are free to do what you want to do. However, don't listen to the noise around you and do what you like.
